# FPGA-Based-2-Player-Fighting-Game
This project involves the design and implementation of a minimalistic yet engaging fighting game for two players, built entirely in hardware using Verilog HDL and deployed on an FPGA development board.

The game is inspired by Footsies, an open-source fighting game developed by HiFight - detailed information about the game mechanics and design can be found on the official website. To develop a deeper understanding of game mechanics and terminology, it is recommended to play the original game. The game includes helpful features such as frame-by-frame playback and debug visualizations (e.g., hitbox overlays), which can aid in analyzing gameplay and understanding timing and interactions more precisely.

In the game, each player controls a character who can move within a 2D arena and perform attacks with the goal of reducing the opponentâ€™s health to zero. The game will run in real time on an FPGA with output on a VGA display and will feature physical input via a keypad.
